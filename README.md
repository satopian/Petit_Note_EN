# Petit_Note_EN
PHP script for PaintBBS,ChickenPaint, and Klecks https://paintbbs.sakura.ne.jp/

## This is English version of Petit Note

Petit Note originally supported English display, but the configuration file config.php was in Japanese.  
I translated the config.php from Japanese to English.  
Other than that, it is exactly the same as [Petit Note](https://github.com/satopian/Petit_Note/).  
This electronic bulletin board is displayed in Japanese when the language of the browser is set to Japanese.  
If the set language is not Japanese, it will be displayed in English.  

## support
If you have any questions, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/satopian/Petit_Note_EN/issues) and ask a question.
