# Petit Note EN

Petit Note English ver.
PHP script for PaintBBS,ChickenPaint,tegaki.js and Klecks.
PHP7.3-PHP8.4
https://paintbbs.sakura.ne.jp/

## This is English version of Petit Note

Petit Note originally supported English display, but the configuration file config.php was in Japanese.  
I translated the config.php from Japanese to English.  
Other than that, it is exactly the same as [Petit Note](https://github.com/satopian/Petit_Note/).  
This electronic bulletin board is displayed in Japanese when the language of the browser is set to Japanese.  
If the set language is not Japanese, it will be displayed in English.  

## Required PHP Version.
PHP5.6 or higher environment is required.  
Operation has been confirmed with PHP7.4, PHP8.3, PHP8.4.  
I recommend using PHP8.0 to PHP8.4.  

## support
